/*
- Given two arrays a[] and b[] of same size.Your task is to find the minimum sum of two elements such
that they belong to different arrays and are not at the same index. Here 1<size<101
For ex: a[]={5,6,10,4,9}
b[]={1,2,3,4,5}
Output: 5
Explanation: a[3] + b[0] = 5 is the lowest possible sum amongst all the possible combinations
a[3] + b[0] = 5 is the lowest possible sum amongst all the possible combinations
